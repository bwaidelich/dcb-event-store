# Dynamic Consistency Boundary Event Store for nodejs/typescript

Implementation of the Dynamic Consistency Boundary pattern for nodejs/typescript [described by Sara Pellegrini](https://sara.event-thinking.io/2023/04/kill-aggregate-chapter-1-I-am-here-to-kill-the-aggregate.html)

Work in progress, but the idea is to create an NPM package, allowing creation of different storage adapaters.

## Usage
For now, best to view the examples in the tests starting with the "testData" directory, to get an idea of how it should be used.

## Specification

See [Specification.md](Specification.md) (work in progress)
